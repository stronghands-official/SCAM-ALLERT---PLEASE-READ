# STRONGHANDS DAO -- COMMUNITY DEMANDS


DEVELOPER NOTE

Alex Personal Statement:

Instead of giving proofs against what I said, these guys decided to point all fingers at me, exposing my personal life and blaming me for everything they can’t prove.

All I can tell you about this shady statements they made is FOLLOW THE MONEY! Blockchain never lies. You must before anything else ask this “core team” to prove they are the good guys and I am the vilain. The reason I decided to come to public and tell everything is because I am concerned about the future of the project. And not the opposite. You all must demand proofs! Papers and documents are proofs. The rest is just non sense talk!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A person Called Roel Piergoelan who claims to be the “new project manager”, who has never being part of the community before the crisis, has no authority to speak in name of the community, so you must be aware of that. Roel was invited by me to help intermediate the crisis, in order to charge Valter to accomplish his duty, and deliver the accountancy, a detailed report to the team, but im meantime, Roel join the conspiracy, take me out from the team, and build a FAKE DAO wallet controlled by the 3 persons that are under suspicious. Roel received 800.000 ISHND tokens, sent by me to his wallet, under Valter accordancy, so thats not true he got no money to get involved. his solution for the crisis, to come to public to say “i’ve checked all and it’s everything ok , so let’s move on, no questions made”…. Since Roel fail to achieve to solve the crisis and manage to join the conspiracy , he need to give back the tokens or send it to te burn address, and leave the “team”.

According to the 3th member of the conspiracy, Mike Larry-Reed (aka bitcoinbabys) under his personal view, Stronghands community must be treated like a “grocery store” , and nobody as the right to ask anything about the funds.
 



According to them, i was “self titled” CTO, which is not true. They gave me the title. Actually i am the only person in charge that really accomplish his duties: I have decision power, Manage infrastructure, lead the development and deliver technology to the community. that’s exactly what i have done through the past 2 years. In other hand, bitcoinbabys who self titled “community manager” have not deliver any work in the past 2 years. he hasn’t even made a tweet about the project and now he claims to be head of whatever, and honestly I haven’t seen any relevant skills of this person for the project as a professional, despite his value as an old school collaborator.

Same for VDR who claims to be the “head of finances” but refuses to deliver community the accountability and financial report.

There is no more core team and no one else is by any means authorized to publish any information unless via the official github account (https://github.com/stronghands-official) and official medium blog. I am really sorry for what happened, and I reiterate that your investment is safe while the blockchain is paused. The remaining tokens under team custody will be sent to the DAO control under the custody of the entire community.

## COMMUNITY DEMANDS:

1 — TO send all the tokens to a DAO controlled by all the 2400 holders, excluding the rich wallets. all holders bellow 100k coins can join the DAO, to avoid wale influence.

2 — To send ALL the remaining money resulted from ITO Pre-sale, to the same DAO Wallet, controlled by the community.

3 — Community elections to choose a new team, to deliver the work in progress. Blockchain is a Technology made by high skilled developers, who know exactly what are they doing. A Crypto Community must be managed and developed by professionals, and owned and sponsored by the community.

4 — a full financial report, analytical, self explained, all the invoices, contracts and wallet addresses included , for the every single cent spent from the ITO wallets.

5 — Every single CENT to be spent must be submitted to DAO for audit and approval of the community.

Right after the DAO Implementation, and all the community holders owned the token contract, i will renounce the ownership, giving back all the token for your real owners, the StrongHands Community.

 

### PS: NEVER SWAP YOUR COINS TO ANOTHER CONTRACT, YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MONEY. The contract will be unpaused after the DAO implementation. This is the only official communication channel, all others are compromised. Wait for the new instructions.

 

The future of Stronghands is now in the Community hands — a personal statement from Alex Freire, CTO of the Stronghands Community.
